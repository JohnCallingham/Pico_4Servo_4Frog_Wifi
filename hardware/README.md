This is Revision B of version 4 of the Pico Servo Frog board.<br>
The board allows for four servos to be connected via male headers. There are eight TLP241s used to switch the four frogs between the J and K wires of the DCC bus.<br>
Eight LEDs show the polarity of each of the four frogs.<br>
The frog switching outputs are wired independently of the servos and need to be configured in JMRI to be associated with the correct servo.
